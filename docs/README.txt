The source codes are included in the src/ folder. They need to be run in the Window OS, Debug mode in Qt Creator ver 5.9.9 in C++11 and MinGW_32bit kit pack. Click the "Newbee12 .pro" to run the code. Because the MinGW_32bit kit is an old pack and the Qt version is old, you may fail to run the source code for many reasons. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering this, we packaged the project into a executable software in the ALPHA MODEL folder. You can download this folder (or the corresponding .zip pack), open and click the "ALPHA MODEL .exe" to run this program without Qt creator. We recommend you to run the program in this way.

The test data is excel_example.xlsx. You can use this file as input data.
